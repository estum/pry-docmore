# pry-docmore

You might have noticed that there are parts of the system that
[pry](http://pry.github.com/) doesn't quite reach, even if you install
[pry-doc](https://rubygems.org/gems/pry-doc), such as keywords and the vars like $0, $:, etc.

This project will fix that, and anything else along these lines.

## Wiki-sourced.

This project's [wiki](https://github.com/rking/pry-docmore/wiki/_pages) hosts
the canonical home for the data.

Edit away!  (I mean that. I'd love to add in whatever additional thoguhts you
have. The goal is to be really informative, so your perspective and examples
count for a lot in my book.)
